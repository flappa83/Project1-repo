Hello my friend, how come you know so many linux commands?
I had a problem going into this file at first because of how you named it :(
I really see that you are a guru in linux
Let me stop here for now and try commiting....not murder of course :)


Now that the above lines were successfully added in the CLI,
I will be adding these lines in the GUI
Now let me commit and see how to fetch that back to local...
